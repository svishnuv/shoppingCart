•	The application should be using something to pre-process the TypeScript files - such as webpack, grunt, gulp or even functions built into an IDE like WebStorm.
•	Please include the generated JS files - for ease of running the application.

Bonus points:

1. Dependency management using npm or bower.
2. Uses the new angular router / component router
3. Uses a CSS pre-processor like Less or Sass
4. Hosted on an open-source repository (like GitHub)

**Attached zip files will always have the javascript files removed. Please have your the candidate post their solution on the internet somewhere – preferably via GitHub. You can then include the link in the resume in order for the manager to review.**

TypeScript is a requirement for the assesment. The manager will not schedule an interview if the assignment does not include a TypeScript implementation.
